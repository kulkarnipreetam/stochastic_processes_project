# üìà Apple Stock Price Analysis using Markov Chains

## üìò Introduction & Background

This project explores the use of **Markov Chains** to model and simulate the daily return of **Apple's stock** based on historical data. In the ever-changing financial market, stock price movements are influenced by company performance, economic indicators, and investor behavior. By leveraging a stochastic modeling approach, this analysis aims to uncover transition dynamics in Apple's returns, offering insights into trend behavior and helping investors make data-informed decisions.

## üéØ Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to:

- Analyze Apple's historical stock prices.
- Use Markov Chains to define states based on daily returns.
- Calculate transition probabilities and long-run behavior.
- Simulate possible future stock prices to guide investment decisions.

## üîç Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Apple stock closing prices were retrieved from Google Finance for a period of ~2035 trading days.
2. **Daily Returns**: Daily returns were calculated and visualized, revealing a fat-tailed, non-normal distribution.
3. **State Definition**: Returns were divided into 4 states based on percentiles:

| State | Description   | Percentile Range | Return Range (%)        |
|:-------:|:---------------|:------------------:|:--------------------------:|
| 1     | Bear          | 0‚Äì25%            | -12.87 to -0.76         |
| 2     | Stagnant      | 26‚Äì50%           | -0.77 to 0.08           |
| 3     | Low Return    | 51‚Äì75%           | 0.09 to 1.03            |
| 4     | Bull          | 76‚Äì100%          | 1.04 to 11.97           |

4. **Transition Matrix (P-Matrix)**:
   - Represents one-step transition probabilities between states.
   - Ensures ergodicity and irreducibility.

| From \ To |   State 1   |   State 2   |   State 3   |   State 4   |
|:-----------|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| **State 1** |   0.297     |   0.169     |   0.220     |   0.313     |
| **State 2** |   0.234     |   0.263     |   0.285     |   0.218     |
| **State 3** |   0.207     |   0.308     |   0.266     |   0.219     |
| **State 4** |   0.259     |   0.261     |   0.228     |   0.251     |

5. **Steady-State Probabilities**:
   - Converge quickly to: œÄ = (0.2493, 0.2504, 0.25, 0.2503)
   - Mean recurrence times: all ~4 transitions.

6. **Simulation**:
   - Starting stock price: **$166**, initial state: **Bear (1)**
   - Simulated stock prices over 50 days using Monte Carlo simulation.

## üìä Results & Visualizations

- **Single 50-Day Simulation**: Showed both profit and loss opportunities.
- **1000 Simulations**:
  - Mean final price ‚âà **$161.94**
  - 5th percentile ‚âà **$79.9**, 95th percentile ‚âà **$275.7**
  - Possible closing prices ranged from **$37.25 to $462.95**

## üßæ Conclusion

- Markov Chains effectively modeled and simulated stock return dynamics.
- The system reached a steady-state after only a few transitions.
- While simulations give an insight into possible future behaviors, external factors like news, company policies, product launches, and geopolitical events must also be considered before making investment decisions.
- This methodology can be adapted for shorter durations or other stocks to assist in identifying profitable investment windows.
